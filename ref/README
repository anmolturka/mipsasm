mips32.txt: O32 / MIPS32 reference (targeted at spim). This is from the
	book, and is designed to work with spim.
mips64.txt: MIPS64 reference (targeted at OpenBSD). This should be used
	for writing assembly on OpenBSD. Some of the information may be
	useful on other platforms, but the syscall list almost certainly
	will not.
openbsd_mips64_syscall.h: the syscall header file from an OpenBSD
	MIPS64 machine (an SGI O2).
