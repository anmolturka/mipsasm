MIPSASM

Working through Britton's MIPS Assembly Language Programming (ISBN
978-0131420441). Primary development machine is an SGI O2 running
OpenBSD, which uses the 64-bit ABI. The default target is this. A
32-bit target for spim is also available by setting TARGET=spim.

The spim version is typically written first to verify the basic
MIPS32 code taught by the book. The MIPS64 version is then written.

Where applicable, this code is released under the ISC license.
