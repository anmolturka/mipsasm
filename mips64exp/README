MIPS64EXP

In this folder are several test files wherein I attempt to figure
out how to use the syscalls, at least for OpenBSD.mips64.

owrite.S:	open ``tmp.out'' and write the string ``hello\n'',
oread.S:	open ``tmp.out'', read up to 10 characters, and write
		the characters to standard out.
linktmp.S:	hard link ``tmp.out'' to ``tmp_link.out''.
unlinktmp.S:	unlink ``tmp.out'' and ``tmp_link.out''.
daemon.S:	double-forks, sleeps 5 seconds, and exits. Prints
		status to console when parent exits, the child
		exits, and the daemon exits. Total run time is ~10s.
