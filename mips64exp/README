MIPS64EXP

In this folder are several test files wherein I attempt to figure
out how to use the syscalls, at least for OpenBSD.mips64.

owrite.S:	open ``tmp.out'' and write the string ``hello\n'',
oread.S:	open ``tmp.out'', read up to 10 characters, and write
		the characters to standard out.
linktmp.S:	hard link ``tmp.out'' to ``tmp_link.out''.
unlinktmp.S:	unlink ``tmp.out'' and ``tmp_link.out''.
daemon.S:	double-forks, sleeps 5 seconds, and exits. Prints
		status to console when parent exits, the child
		exits, and the daemon exits. Total run time is ~10s.

util.S
------
util.S contains non-reentrant code useful in a lot of programs. The
functions provided are:

	strlen: takes the address of a NULL-terminated string in $a0
		and returns the length in bytes in $v0.
	sleep: the number of seconds to sleep should be stored in
		$a0, and the number of nanoseconds to sleep in $1.
		No mechanism is provided to determine if the sleep
		was interrupted (i.e. via a signal).
	print: print a string to standard output. The string should
		NULL-terminated and its address loaded into $a0.
